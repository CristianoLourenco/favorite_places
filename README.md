Favourite Places Project

## Getting Started

This project is a project to show the places I pass by and 
wanted to regist the moment and the location.

it's part of a series of projects to practice my skills.

Principal features are:
 * using native features like camera to take fotos of the place;
 * use the maps google api to select the location of the place;
